Algebras
========
Algebras are a collection of `objects` and `operators`; operators are `functions` that take one, two or more of these objects and return another of these objects. 

Also when defining algebras, one may `find truths` that are `always true` for the `relationships defined between the objects by the operators`, these are called `properties`.

We also may discover that `some of these properties are necessary` to define a model through a certain algebra, we call these properties `laws`.

Both properties and laws are advantageous to understand the domain that the algebra is modeling, and as well to gain knowledge for free once we discover that a new domain fits an algebra.

Challenge 1
-----------
On a document, answer as concise and complete as possible the next questions:

1. What are algebras?
2. Give 3 examples of algebras, and at least 1 which is not widely known.
3. How can they be used as a tool to reason about a domain?
4. How do we generalize an algebra?
5. How do we make sure that a domain fits a generalized algebra?

Challenge 2
-----------
Make the necessary materials to be able to teach this concept to someone in a 1 on 1 session, and do so to at least someone else. The success of the challenge is measured on how well that person can explain the topic back or to someone else.
