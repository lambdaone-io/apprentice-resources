Commutative Diagrams
====================

A commutative diagram picks objects and morphisms of a category such that all
paths that share the same initial object endup in the same other object. This
allows us to identify equivalence between composition of morphisms.

### IOHK use case with Cardano
Has great use case, at around 24:30 commutative diagrams are mentioned, but the whole video gives a context on why formal specifications are so important and how a commutative diagram allows you to design and code around it.

### Categories great and small
Has a good explanation of how to form categories, giving a better background to the origin of commutative diagrams.

Challenge 1
-----------

On a document, answer as concise and complete as possible the next questions:

  1. What are commutative diagrams?
  2. Give 3 examples of commutative diagrams on useful categories even if it is a simple one like a monoid category.
  3. How can they be used as a tool to reason about a domain?
  4. How can they be used as a tool to design and develop code?

Challenge 2
-----------

Make the necessary materials in order to be able to teach this concept to someone
in a 1 on 1 session, and do so to at least someone else. The success of the
challenge is measured on how well that person can explain the topic back or to
someone else.
